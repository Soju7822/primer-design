comparsion results for primer design

1. the size results for different run lengths of code C_{R8}_{(2)} can be checked in directory: primer_length _12/size results/size_diffent_run.mat

2. the size results for different run lengths of code C_{R8}_{(3)} can be checked in directory: primer_length _13/run_length/size results/size_diffent_run.mat

3.  the size results for different run lengths of code C_{R8-GC}_{(3)} can be checked in directory:primer_length _13/balanced_with_run/size results/size_diffent_run.mat

4.  For the size results for different run lengths of codes C_{R8-H}_{(2)} and C_{R11-GH}_{(2)}, since the size is relatively small (q^(k-1)=4^(2-1)) and the construction is based on (12,1) cyclic code for n=12 and k=2, we did not make the coding source for them, and calculated it by hand.
